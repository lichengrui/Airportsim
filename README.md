Airport Simulation

## Description

The optimization of the operations of the airport system relies heavily on passenger simulations. While various models and simulation techniques have been developed, improvements can be achieved by incorporating discrete events simulation (DES), agent-based modeling (ABM), and machine learning approaches. Our model aims to replicate the flow of individual passengers and aircraft through an airport facility while accounting for variables like traveler behavior, staffing levels, and resource limitations. The goal of the project is to give airport management a more useful tool for system optimization by merging various simulation approaches and machine learning algorithms.
